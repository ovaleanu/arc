# Connecting a simple Kubernetes Kind cluster to Azure Arc

Azure Arc is part of the Microsoft strategy for hybrid cloud deployments and management. With Azure Arc you can now manage virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and databases as if they are running in Azure.

Now Azure Arc allows to manage the following resources outside of Azure:

Servers - Bare Metal or Virtual Machines running Linux or Windows
Kubernetes clusters - Multiple distributions are supported
Data Services - Azure SQL Database and PostgreSQL Hyperscale services
